              <summary class="summ">TRAVELOOKO: Web-based Social Media Application for Travel Organizers and Tour Joiners, as well as Do It Yourself (DIY) Instructions for Your Dream Destination.</summary>
              <h2>Purpose and Description of the Study</h2>

              Travelooko will be a web-based social media application designed for people who love to travel and for travel organizers wherein they can post all the travel dates available for people who want to join and for people who are looking for other groups of people to join in. The application will also include Do It Yourself (DIY) instructions on how to get to the place where they want to go and what to bring on their trip. The Do It Yourself (DIY) instruction will be a feature wherein end-users can share information on how to go to a certain place. In addition, the Do It Yourself (DIY) instructions will be beneficial for every user who wants to use it. The developers wanted the user not to just find tour packages but also to make friends and build community with users of Travelooko.<br /><br /><br/>                                   

              Furthermore, the web-based social media application Travelooko has a registration field wherein users must create an account first using their device to be able to use the system and see the places posted on the news feed that are available to join in and see the Do It Yourself (DIY) instructions provided. They can browse by customizing the places they only want to see and not browse all the way down and see random posts, they can only see the places they want to go to and dates to join in through the use of search button and be able to reserve their slot by clicking the post and set the dates when they want to travel, or by simply reaching out the organizer through direct message to know more about the organized tour and reserve their slot.<br /><br /><br/>                                   

              The system will ask for verification upon registration by providing a valid identification under the terms and conditions if they want to continue using the application. Once confirmed, they will have a badge that they are verified. This will be to ensure and prove that they are who they claim to be. It is to prevent anyone from carrying out a process on other people’s behalf without authorization, creating false identities, or committing fraud. The user can easily manage their account information and their post under the profile section. There will be a menu for every user who posted an organized tour to see the event posted and see how many people have reserved their slot on the designated dates they want to travel. The users can message other users, but they will have an option whether to accept it and continue the communication or deny the message. The user will be able to set their profile’s privacy and customize their profile or even disable or delete their account.<br /><br /><br/>

              <summary class="summ">Website Booking and Reservation System for JomerVentures</summary>
              <h3>Project Context</h3>
              JomerVentures is using Facebook for customers to reserve and book their slot for their travel through Facebook messaging or text messaging. The page typically replies within a few hours. JomerVentures doesn’t have a website for the customers to automatically book or reserve their travel, unlike the other travel agencies where you can book or reserve your slot online. The booking or reservation of travel and tour packages are through messaging only. It does not have many alternative payment methods online  like  paying by credit card, or Paypal. Payments are made through bank transfer, gcash,  or by cash basis.<br /><br />

              JomerVentures being a small and Medium Enterprises (SME) needs to cope up with the technology like other travel agencies. To be able to reach more customers, a website  with a list of their different travel and tour packages within the Philippines and can be booked conveniently with just on the customers fingertips must be developed. On this website, customers can book or reserve their slot conveniently and be able to pay using different payment methods. Asking frequently asked questions (FAQ’s) will be answered automatically by the help of a dedicated page. A bot will also be programmed to respond to customer’s questions if they cannot find their answer on the FAQ page. With this, more customers will have access to a more convenient booking or reservation without the need of having a long conversation with the organizer.<br /><br /><br/>                                   
              <h3>Purpose and Description of the Project</h3>
              The purpose of this project is to create a website booking and reservation system for JomerVentures wherein all travel and tour packages will be posted and be able to book and reserve conveniently. From the list of posted packages, customers can choose which place they would like to go and book and pay with different payment schemes or reserve the location.

              The system will have a 24 hours cancellation upon reservation in case the customer has changed their plan. The system will display all the tour packages and its information such as the inclusions of the tour, how much it cost and travel time.<br /><br /><br />
